Sup,

I'm Mangotic and based in Stuttgart, Germany.

Currently I am finishing my apprenticeship as a Software Developer. 

JavaScript and all its subtypes are known to me and are being used daily altough not as successful as I want it to be... 

I'm currently learning Swift and I have set my goals to finish an app in 3-6 months.

How to get to know me:
